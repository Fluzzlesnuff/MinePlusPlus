# Developer Information
As an open-source project, contributions to Mine++ are greatly appreciated. Here's some information to help you contribute in a helpful manner.
## Permissions
Force pushing is not available, due to the potential risks. However, pull requests are allowed and encouraged.
## Code Life-Cycle
The code in the `main` branch should be release-ready, so there is an efficient process to get code from the early development and testing stages to release.
`development`: This is the pre-alpha branch, where force-pushing *is* enabled. Even buggy, crash-inducing changes can be commuted to this branch.
`alpha`: Once code has been more or less de-bugged, it can be moved (via a pull request) to here. This code should be playable, but is unfinished.
`beta`: Only well-tested code should be moved here. The code in this branch is fully functional and ready for release. It sits here and goes through beta testing until enough features have been added for a release.
`main`: Fully released, polished code. Anyone who just wants to play the game should download from here.
