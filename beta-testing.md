# Beta Testing
## Why Beta Test?
If you want to try out future features, and help the developers along the way, beta testing is a good option. You can experience coming addions to the game without risking losing your worlds.
## How to Beta Test
Starting beta testing is simple. Just download the files from the `beta` branch and install the game as usual. Hardware changes will rarely be needed, and if so, they will be optional. Start playing, and see what features and bugs you find!
## Reporting Issues
If you find a bug in the beta version, please use GitHub's **Issues** feature to report it. Please include as much information as possible about the problem, like
* Which version exhibited the bug (you can find the version number at the top of the MinePlusPlus.ini file)?
* What world size are you playing on?
* What *exactly* happened?
* How long had the world been running for?

Happy Beta Testing!
